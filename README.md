Why this project?
This is the capstone project of the Nanodegree program that allows you to demonstrate all the components you've learned throughout the program in a single final product.

Imagine that you are the Android developer at a merchandise startup, tasked with building out their inventory app. Consider the user workflow, user needs, and backend database storage needs as you plan.

You will need to pull together your knowledge of app planning, navigating between multiple activities, databases, networking, and UI development. A strong foundation in these skills are foundational to Android development worldwide. By practicing these skills and building this app, you will have the foundation to build similar apps for any kind of business.
